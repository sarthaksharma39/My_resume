<h2>Introduction</h2>
<body>
<br>
    <h3>Good morning,</h3>
    <p>	I am Sarthak sharma. I belong to Chamba, Himachal Pradesh also
    known as “Dev Bhoomi”. I’m currently living in Chandigarh and
    pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer science at Dr. B R Ambedkar
    National institute of Technology, Jalandhar.<br>
    I did most of my study at Kendriya vidyalaya no. 1 Bathinda cantt and
    scored 92% in my boards.<br>
    I live in a nuclear family with my parents and an elder sister. My father
    is armed personnel because of whom I got many opportunities to live
    and visit different cities like Leh, Dehradun and Bathinda. Beside that
    my mother, she is a homemaker and my sister is pursuing her
    graduation.<br>
    Talking about my hobbies I love watching movies specifically sci-fi
    ones. In addition, I do internet surfing a lot and would love to play
    badminton in outdoors and prefer playing chess in indoors.<br>
    My strength is that I’m very disciplined and dedicated to whatever
    work I do. And I always believe in myself and my honesty for work.
    And as far as my weaknesses are concerned, I think I have only one
    that is I can focus on only one thing at a time.<br>
    My goal is to achieve excellence in my skills. And my long-term goal
    is to be a renowned engineer and reach the highest level of success
    being kind and compassionate.<br>
    That’s all about me. Thank you for providing me such a great
    opportunity to introduce myself.<br>
